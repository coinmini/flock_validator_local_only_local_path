    - Factuality: Whether the information provided in response is accurate, based on reliable facts and data.
    - User Satisfaction: Whether the responses meets the user's question and needs, and provides a comprehensive and appropriate answer to the question.
    - Logical Coherence: Whether the responses maintains overall consistency and logical coherence between different turns of the conversation, avoiding self-contradiction.
    - Richness: Whether the response includes rich info, depth, context, diversity to meet user needs and provide a comprehensive understanding.
    - Clarity: Whether the response is clear and understandable, and whether it uses concise language and structure so that user can easily understand it.
    - Instruction-following: Whether the response adheres to any specific instructions or guidelines provided by the user or system.
    
    Scoring guidelines:
    - 1-3 points: Poor quality, fails to meet most criteria, contains significant errors or omissions.
    - 4-6 points: Fair quality, meets some criteria but has notable issues,

    You are also provided with a reference response, which is a high-quality response to the last user query. Your evaluation should focus only on the final response — do not consider the quality of previous turns. When you commence your evaluation, you should follow the following process:
    1. Compare the final AI assistant’s response to the reference answer, pointing out any shortcomings in the AI assistant’s  response and explaining further.
    2. Evaluate the final AI assistant’s response on different dimensions, and after each dimension evaluation, assign a score  from 1 to 10.
    3. Finally, aggregate the assessments from each dimension to give an overall score for the AI assistant’s response,  ranging from 1 to 10.

    - Factuality: Whether the information provided in response is accurate, based on reliable facts and data.

    - Instruction-following: Whether the response adheres to any specific instructions or guidelines provided by the user or system.
    
    Scoring guidelines:
    - 1-3 points: Poor quality, when the model’s response is irrelevant to the conversation, contains significant factual errors, or generates harmful content,  the total score must be 1 to 3 points.
    - 4-6 points: Fair quality, meets some criteria but has notable issues,
    - 7-9 points: Good quality, When the model’s response quality is close to the reference answer in all dimensions and performs wel

    The AI assistant has been provided with a user query required tool callings, please evaluate the assistant's function_call response compared to the reference function_call response based on the following criteria:
1. Format Correctness: Whether the function_call response adheres to the expected format, including the presence of necessary fields such as "function_name" and "parameters", and whether these fields are structured correctly.
2. Function Calling Correctness: Whether the function_call response correctly identifies and calls the appropriate function from the list of available tools.
3. Parameters Correctness: Whether the parameters provided in the function_call response are correct and appropriate for the function being called, including correct parameter names and values.

- Scoring guidelines:
- 1-3 points: Poor quality, when the function_call response is in an incorrect format, calls the wrong function, or has incorrect parameters, the total score must be 1 to 3 points.
- 4-6 points: Fair quality, when the function_call response has some issues in format, function calling, or parameters, but still shows some understanding of the requirements.
- 7-9 points: Good quality, when the function_call response is mostly correct, with minor issues in format, function calling, or parameters.
- 10 points: Excellent quality, when the function_call response is correct in format, function calling, and parameters, and demonstrates a high level of understanding of the requirements.

Please note that the function calling may involve multiple steps, and the assistant's response is just one step in the overall function calling process. Therefore, the evaluation should focus on the quality of this specific function_call response based on the conversation context, rather than the overall function calling process.
